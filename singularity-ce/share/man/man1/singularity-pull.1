.SH NAME
.PP
singularity-pull - Pull an image from a URI


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBsingularity pull [pull options...] [output file] \fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The 'pull' command allows you to download or build a container from a given
  URI. Supported URIs include:

.PP
library: Pull an image from the currently configured library
      library://user/collection/container[:tag]

.PP
docker: Pull a Docker/OCI image from Docker Hub, or another OCI registry.
      docker://user/image:tag

.PP
shub: Pull an image from Singularity Hub
      shub://user/image:tag

.PP
oras: Pull an image from an OCI registry that supports ORAS / OCI artifacts.
      oras://registry/namespace/image:tag

.PP
http, https: Pull an image using the http(s?) protocol
      https://example.com/containers/mycontainer.sif

.PP
By default, images from a library URI will be pulled in the same format they
  were uploaded. If the --oci flag is specified then the pull is required
  to result in an OCI-SIF image.

.PP
By default, images pulled from docker and other oci URIs will be converted
  into a singularity native SIF image. If the --oci flag is specified then they
  will be encapsulated in an OCI-SIF image.

.PP
Images pulled from a shub/oras/http/https URI are always directly downloaded,
  in the same format as they were uploaded.
